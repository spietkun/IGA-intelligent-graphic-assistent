IGA - your best friend to help You customize the wallpaper
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B [-h] [-v] [-q]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B IGA
is a programme that helps the user to choose (instead of him) the best wallpaper. In a very simple way, it maximally reduces the time of searching for the best screen image. It works in 2 modes: 
.B setting totally random wallpaper 
from the picture base and 
.B matching an individual wallpaper 
based on the replies made by the user to the questions. At the start there are basic wallpapers, but there is a possibility to add your own pictures. After doing this, the user chooses "key words" that are related to the uploaded photo.

.SH BUGS
After adding a photo to the base, there is a glib warning: 
.I (zenity:2982): GLib-WARNING **: while getting flags for FD
caused by using pipe to zenity. It doesn't affect the programme at all.
